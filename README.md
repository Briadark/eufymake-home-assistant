# eufyMake E1 for Home Assistant

[![Open this repository in HACS.](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/hacs_repository.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/hacs_repository/?owner=Briadark&repository=eufymake-home-assistant&category=integration)

Custom Home Assistant integration for the **eufyMake E1 UV printer** and its linked **Purifier P1**.

The integration connects through eufyMake's cloud and MQTT services and exposes printer status, ink information, accessory state, device metadata, and Purifier P1 controls in Home Assistant.

## Features

### eufyMake E1

- Setup from the Home Assistant integrations UI
- eufyMake account login with country selection, email, password, and CAPTCHA support
- Availability and connectivity sensors
- Firmware information
- Current accessory detection
- Read-only notification sound and fill-in light state
- Ink level monitoring
- Ink manufacture and expiration information
- Days-until-expiration sensors
- Waste ink monitoring
- Device information including model, serial number, firmware, and hardware revision when available
- Bundled MQTT certificate, so no certificate file from the Windows app is required

### Purifier P1

When a Purifier P1 is linked to the E1, it is exposed as a separate Home Assistant device connected through the E1.

Supported functionality includes:

- Purifier status
- Purifier mode control:
  - Standby
  - Silent
  - High
  - Full power
  - Auto
- Auto delay-off control:
  - Immediately
  - 1 minute
  - 3 minutes
  - 5 minutes
  - 10 minutes
- Model and serial number
- Firmware version
- Hardware revision when provided by eufyMake

## Compatibility

### Supported

- **eufyMake E1 UV Printer**
  - Station model: `V8260`
- **eufyMake Purifier P1**
  - Model: `T5216` / `TS5216`
  - Must be linked to an E1

### Not supported

- **AnkerMake M5 / eufyMake Studio 3D printer**
  - Station model: `V8111`

Support for additional eufyMake devices may be added in the future.

## Installation with HACS

1. Make sure [HACS](https://www.hacs.xyz/) is installed in Home Assistant.
2. Click the HACS button at the top of this page.
3. Add this repository as an **Integration**.
4. Download **eufyMake E1**.
5. Restart Home Assistant.
6. Go to **Settings -> Devices & services -> Add integration**.
7. Search for **eufyMake E1**.

## Setup

Enter your eufyMake account details:

- Country
- Email
- Password

If eufyMake requests CAPTCHA verification, Home Assistant will display the CAPTCHA image and ask for the answer before continuing.

Your password is used only during authentication and is **not stored** in the Home Assistant config entry.

### Upgrading from an older version

Existing installations can upgrade normally through HACS.

An older installation may receive a Home Assistant **reauthentication** request after upgrading. This is expected when the existing config entry does not yet contain the newer cloud authentication information required for features such as Purifier P1 support.

## Devices and entities

The E1 is created as its own Home Assistant device.

If a Purifier P1 is detected, Home Assistant creates a separate Purifier P1 device and links it to the E1 using Home Assistant's device hierarchy.

Device information can include:

- Product/model number
- Serial number
- Firmware version
- Hardware revision, when provided by eufyMake

For example:

- E1 model: `E1 (V8260)`
- Purifier model: `Purifier P1 (T5216)`

## Dashboard example

The example below uses only built-in Home Assistant cards. Entity IDs may differ depending on your Home Assistant installation.

## How it works

The eufyMake E1 does not currently provide a documented public Home Assistant API.

This integration uses the same general cloud and MQTT communication paths used by eufyMake software to retrieve device state and send supported commands.

Because these interfaces are undocumented, eufyMake firmware or cloud changes may require updates to this integration.

## Privacy and security

- Your eufyMake password is not stored in the Home Assistant config entry.
- Authentication tokens and device credentials are stored by Home Assistant because they are required for continued communication with the device.
- Do not publish Home Assistant diagnostics, logs, packet captures, or cache exports without reviewing them first.

They may contain:

- Authentication tokens
- Serial numbers
- Device keys
- Account identifiers

## Issues and feedback

If you find a bug or have information about another eufyMake device, please open an issue:

https://github.com/Briadark/eufymake-home-assistant/issues

When reporting a problem, avoid posting credentials, authentication tokens, device keys, or other private account information.
